# Money IRL

**Money IRL** is a calm, scenario based mobile app designed to help people practice real-life money decisions without pressure, judgment or gamification.

Instead of teaching rules or giving financial advice, Money IRL creates space for reflection, awareness and emotional safety—because real financial literacy begins with understanding *how* we make decisions, not just *what* decisions we make.

## Philosophy

Money IRL is built on a simple belief:

> Financial literacy should feel human, gentle and permission-giving.

There are no scores, rankings, or “right answers.” Progress is acknowledged through reassurance, not metrics. The app respects privacy, pace and personal context.

## What the App Does

Money IRL guides users through a complete learning loop:

1. **Onboarding**
   Users share their life situation and intentions to ground the experience in reality.

2. **Scenario Practice**
   Users face everyday financial situations and choose how they would respond.

3. **Reflection**
   After each scenario, users pause to reflect on how the decision felt and what influenced it.

4. **Reassurance**
   A gentle message acknowledges the effort of reflection and encourages self-compassion.

5. **Continuation**
   Users return to scenarios at their own pace, with progress saved locally.

The experience is intentionally lightweight, private and distraction-free.

## Built With

Money IRL is built using a modern, minimal mobile stack:

* **Dart** — primary programming language
* **Flutter** — cross-platform mobile framework
* **Riverpod** — state management
* **GoRouter** — navigation and routing
* **Hive** — local, offline-first persistence
* **Material 3** — UI design system

The MVP runs entirely on-device with no backend or cloud dependencies.

## Project Status

**Current version:** MVP v0.1

At this stage, Money IRL:

* is fully functional end-to-end
* supports offline use
* remembers user progress across sessions
* has been tested on a real Android device

The MVP is intentionally frozen to preserve stability while gathering feedback.

## Future Prospects

Future development will remain values-driven and incremental. Planned directions include:

* Expanding the library of real-life scenarios
* Deepening reflection prompts while keeping them optional
* Introducing optional progress summaries (never scores)
* Improving accessibility and visual polish
* Supporting optional accounts *only* for cross-device continuity
* Exploring educator or community-focused adaptations

Any future features will be evaluated against one core question:

> Does this make learning about money feel safer and more human?

## Guiding Principles

* Calm over urgency
* Reflection over instruction
* Awareness over performance
* Privacy over data collection
* Function before polish

These principles guide both product and technical decisions.

## Contributing

Money IRL is currently in an early, exploratory stage. Feedback, ideas and thoughtful discussion are welcome. Contributions will be evaluated with care to ensure alignment with the project’s values.

## Closing Note

Money IRL is not trying to fix people’s finances.

It’s trying to give people a place to slow down, notice their patterns and practice money decisions without fear.

**Money IRL — Pracice real-life money decisions.**
